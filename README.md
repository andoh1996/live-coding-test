# Backend Developer Test â€“ User Authentication API

Project Overview

This is a backend coding challenge for a live collaboration project with a frontend developer. The goal is to build a secure, well-structured authentication system to support the following flows from the provided Figma design:

User Registration
Login
Password Reset via OTP
Email Verification

# Features to Implement

User registration with:

First name, last name, email, password, address, phone (with internationalization)
Email/password login

Password reset flow:

Request reset via email
Verify email with OTP
Set and confirm new password
Email verification (OTP-based)

Secure password hashing

Token/session management

Role-based access control (optional)

RESTful API design with consistent JSON responses.

# Tech Stack
Language: Javascript (Nodejs)
Framework: Express Js
Database: Mongodb
Auth Strategy: JWT. JWT is the industry standard for building secure, scalable, stateless REST APIs and mobile backend services. Sessions are great for classic websites. JWTs shine when you have APIs + multiple frontends + scaling needs.
